# FUCK YOU

**A single-purpose page: loud, blunt, and unapologetic — FUCK YOU.**

This is a minimal static one‑pager where the headline is the whole point. A literal, aggressive typographic poster with glitch/noise vibes, built for moments when you want to shout a stance and move on.

## Highlights

- Oversized, in‑your‑face **FUCK YOU** as the core message
- Pure static files, zero dependencies, instant load
- Nginx image ready to deploy
- Extreme, abrasive visual style with max attitude
